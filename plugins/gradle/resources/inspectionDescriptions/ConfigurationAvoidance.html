<p>(Gradle 4.9+) Detects usage of API that interacts with tasks eagerly.<br>
  Eager interaction with tasks implies a lot of difficulties:
  <ul>
  <li>The user should manually set up all dependencies between tasks;</li>
  <li> In the <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_lifecycle.html#sec:build_phases">configuration phase</a>, all the tasks accessed via the eager API become configured, even if they are not executed afterwards. It results in performance degradation.</li>
  </ul>
  Eventually, the eager API will be deprecated in favor of the lazy one. <br>
